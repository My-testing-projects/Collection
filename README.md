# Mobile Automation for EriBank Application

## Project Description

Within this project, I was responsible for automating tests for the EriBank mobile application using Appium. I designed, implemented, and maintained test automation scripts covering various test scenarios such as login, transaction browsing, and payment handling. Additionally, for test reporting purposes, I integrated the scripts with both Allure and the test management tool - Qase. This project provided me with invaluable experience in Appium and insight into the challenges that can arise during mobile application test automation.
