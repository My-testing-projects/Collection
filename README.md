# Mobile Automation for EriBank Application

## Project Description

Within this project, I was responsible for automating tests for the EriBank mobile application using Appium. I designed, implemented, and maintained test automation scripts covering various test scenarios such as login, transaction browsing, and payment handling. Additionally, for test reporting purposes, I integrated the scripts with both Allure and the test management tool - Qase. This project provided me with invaluable experience in Appium and insight into the challenges that can arise during mobile application test automation.

# Automated Testing for Desktop Version of bazylika-pszow.pl

## Project Description

Within this personal project, I focused on automating tests for the https://bazylika-pszow.pl/ website using Playwright inconjunction with Java. My tasks included designing, developing, and maintaining automation test scripts to verify thefunctionality and behavior of the website across various browsers and platforms. I implemented test scenarios coveringdifferent aspects such as navigation, form submissions, and content validation. Additionally, these tests were integratedwith the CircleCI platform for automatic execution as part of the CI/CD process. In addition to test automation, as part ofthe testing effort, I created a test plan outlining testing techniques and conducted a risk analysis. This project provided mewith practical experience in integrating Playwright with Java and understanding the challenges and best practices of webapplication testing.
